Complex-number-aware Convolutional Variational Autoencoder for audio tasks

This Convolutional Variational Autoencoder uses ComplexPytorch (https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/complexPyTorch) to generate a Complex Latent Space. It follows the paradigm described in Nakashika's paper:

Complex-Valued Variational Autoencoder: A Novel Deep Generative Model for Direct Representation of Complex Spectra.
T Nakashika - INTERSPEECH, 2020

It has been tested for beat audio effects. Some samples can be listened in: https://mateocamara.github.io/ .
