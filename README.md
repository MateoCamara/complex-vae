Complex-number-aware Variational Autoencoder for audio tasks

This Variational Autoencoder uses ComplexPytorch (https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/complexPyTorch) to generate a Complex Latent Space. It follows the paradigm described in the following paper:

Complex-Valued Variational Autoencoder: A Novel Deep Generative Model for Direct Representation of Complex Spectra.
T Nakashika - INTERSPEECH, 2020

It has been tested for beat audio effects. Some samples can be listened in: https://mateocamara.github.io/ . Hopefully, a publication about it (plus the whole audio database) will be available soon.
